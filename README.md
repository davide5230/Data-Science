# Wine Quality Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the **Wine Quality Dataset** using **R**. The project covers the full data analysis workflow, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing key statistics and distributions of the variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and wine quality.  
- **Linear Regression**: Building and evaluating linear regression models to predict wine quality.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, understand important features, and build predictive models in R.
